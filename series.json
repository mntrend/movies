Meanwhile, Brett and Cormac have illegally wired into Seamus's satellite dish to watch the soccer final, but all they can get is a kid's show which is doing a live link to Australia where the book is about to go on sale. Unfortunately, Miss Murphy surprises them and then stays to watch the show. Whilst queuing for the book, Hannah uncovers a plot by Wayne to cheat Meredith out of winning a trivia contest. Hannah manages to expose Wayne, but risks exposing her presence in Australia.\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

To save the portal from being plastered over, Brett has to redecorate first and O'Keefe's is throwing out a whole lot of old stage props. In Ireland, the school is on an orienteering course and Hannah's compass is going wild.

Martin isn't using a GPS or compass because he's got a copy of the orienteering map, only he doesn't realise that it's last year's.\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

            "description": "When Nicholas insists on delivering a birthday present to Jackie at her house, he sets the girls some serious problems. He naturally thinks Jackie lives in Hamburg and so the first task for Emma is to find a house that they can pretend is Jackie’s family home. Using a friend’s vacant villa, the three girls quickly set about decorating the place as if it’s about to host a party. When Nicholas arrives it looks like their efforts are successful and all goes to plan. Even when he asks Jackie all sorts of questions about the house and the neighbourhood, Jackie is able to answer quite convincingly. But the perfect plan starts to become seriously unstuck when an unexpected visitor arrives. Mrs Schultz, an immaculately dressed old lady who is the grandmother of the house’s owner shows up. Assuming Emma is the housekeeper, the old woman’s incessant demands cause chaos as the other two girls try to hide from her while also keeping Nicholas away and pretending to him that things are all going along normally. Then Emma accidentally activates the house’s alarm system which instantly brings the police around. Unless Emma, Jackie and Ally can come up with some very persuasive arguments, they are going to find it extremely difficult to talk their way out of this one.\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

            "description": "Ally isn’t happy when she learns that Dan will be staying at her house for a few weeks. Even though she gets on okay with Dan these days, her main worry is about ensuring that the chatroom remains a secret. So relations between the two grow a little tense as Ally tries to make sure that Dan keeps his distance from things. Matters take a turn for the worse though when Dan is bitten by a red-bellied black snake while out on a trail ride with Jackie and Emma. The girls have no option but to use the chatroom to transport an unconscious Dan to Singapore to get the medical attention he needs. Realising that this almost certainly means the existence of the chatroom will be discovered, the girls also know that if Dan’s life is to be saved then that’s the price they’ll have to pay. With the anti-venom administered just in time, Dan groggily wakes up to find himself in Jackie’s bedroom. Looking at the strange buildings outside the window, Dan naturally starts to question his whereabouts. Jackie desperately tries to convince Dan that the skyscrapers he ‘thinks’ he can see are really an hallucination and that he’s still really in the Australian bush. While Dan is still only half awake, there’s a chance that he might actually believe Jackie. But there’s also a chance that he might not.\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

            "description": "When Ally has to do an architecture assignment for school, Emma suggests that she and Jackie join her in Germany to see some real Baroque buildings in the nearby town of Luneburg. The girls spend a delightful time exploring the picturesque town and marvelling at its quaint architectural heritage. Then Jackie spots a lost child by the river. With Emma off somewhere buying lunch, Ally and Jackie have no choice but to take the boy to the nearest police station. Unfortunately their good deed backfires on them when the two girls are asked to provide an official statement. With no documents to prove otherwise, Jackie and Ally realise that legally they have no right to be in Germany. Not wanting to answer any awkward questions, they make a run for it, but disastrously leave their bag in the police station! No bag means no phone and without that, they can’t contact Emma or return home. To make matters worse, they are completely lost. With one policeman trailing them and another randomly calling numbers on the speed dials of their phones, they have to find Emma to help get them out of this mess. But before they can do that the police find them and take them back to the station. With no passports, their bag confiscated and two very curious policeman wanting some straight answers, Jackie and Ally realise they’re in very serious trouble\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

The fun filled shopping expedition takes a turn for the worse however when Jackie’s neighbours from Singapore accidentally spot her! The girls manage to make a quick getaway but when it comes time to return home, the chatroom won’t allow Jackie back to Singapore. She discovers that because of a huge electrical storm over the island, her computer has been turned off. Jackie is forced to make up a stack of excuses to explain why she hasn’t arrived for work at her grandmother’s store. The situation gets worse though when her mother asks her to also do the shopping for dinner that evening. It’s a seemingly simple task but exotic, Chinese groceries are not easily obtained in the outer suburb where Ally lives. The girls realise they’ll have to seriously improvise if they are going to save Jackie’s hide. They manage to pull off the impossible but at the end of the day, the one thing they failed to achieve was to find new costumes for their photo-shoot. Then again, if they could improvise their way around Jackie’s problems, maybe they can tackle the costume issue with the same inventiveness.\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

            "description": "It’s exam time for Emma and she’s suffering from exhaustion. On top of studying all night, it’s coming up to the dance semi-finals and daily rehearsals are intense. Hoping to use her school holidays to get as much practice as possible, Emma is shocked to hear that her father has arranged a family holiday for the entire period. Desperate to get out of going away, Emma tells her parents that Ally and Jackie are coming to stay and she has to remain in Hamburg to look after them. Instantly, Emma’s parents happily agree to stay home as well and help her look after the two girls. This was definitely not the response Emma was hoping for. To their horror, Ally and Jackie learn that they’ll have to be in Hamburg ten hours per day as well as be up and about for another ten hours in a different time zone in their own countries. Not only is this going to seriously affect their training, they have no idea how they’re going to stay active and awake for twenty hours a day! With no time to practise, the three girls see their hopes of successfully competing quickly slipping away. To make matters worse, Emma’s father has arranged to take them all on a trip to Berlin on the same day as the semi-finals. They have to find a way to get out of the trip without hurting the feelings of Emma’s dad. Even more than this, they somehow have to find the energy to properly compete in the dance competition.\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

For the first time in their lives, Jackie and Emma are alone at sea and naturally become very nervous when they start drifting towards the open ocean. Fortunately, the currents take them within range of an island and they decide to brave the depths, jump off the boat and pull it to shore using the bow rope. Finally making it to the beach they head for higher ground only to realise the tide has risen, washing their dinghy away. After trekking to a high cliff top in the hope of finding phone reception, Emma accidentally drops her phone down among some large rocks. When she goes to retrieve it she slips, slides down some rocks and grazes her hands. It’s now up to Jackie, who’s very afraid of heights, to go down and help Emma back up the cliff. In the meantime, Ally has made it to shore, found Dan and they’ve gone back out to sea and found the abandoned dinghy. Now can they find Emma and Jackie?\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

            "description": "To her great dismay, Ally finds herself stuck in the chatroom when her mobile phone fails. Her hopes of a speedy escape are dashed when she learns that Jackie and Emma’s phones are also playing up. Deciding that they should run a check on the program that Josh used to set up the chatroom, Emma and Jackie concoct a plan to get him out of the house so that Jackie can use his computer and diagnostic software. Meanwhile, Ally is alarmingly sent at random around the world without being able no control over where or when she goes anywhere. Finally ending up back in the chatroom, Ally watches in terror as it begins to disintegrate around her. It appears to be getting smaller and smaller, the familiar white glow gets dimmer and everything seems to be closing in on her. The source of the problem is quickly traced to a virus that’s infected the phones of all three girls. But finding the cause of the problem is one thing – solving it is another and neither Emma nor Jackie have much of a clue about what to do. Fortunately – without knowing the full extent of the girls’ problems – Josh is able to provide an answer. But can he apply it before the chatroom disappears altogether and even more important, before Ally disappears with it?\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

            "description": "The girls decide to celebrate the end of their chatroom fourteen days before it’s programmed to shut down completely. Then they can concentrate on what really matters – winning the dance finals. Choosing to have one fun activity in each country, they decide on jet-boating on Sydney Harbour, taking a bungee chair in Singapore and attending a dance party in Hamburg. But the day takes a curious turn when Jackie’s in a shopping mall in Singapore and spots a teenage girl putting stolen CD’s into Chelsea’s bag. When she tries to inform her arch-rival about the incident, Chelsea arrogantly dismisses Jackie with her usual air of lofty superiority. Inevitably, when Chelsea tries to leave, the store security alarms are triggered and she is subsequently charged with shoplifting. Even worse, her father bans her from competing in the dance finals. Although Chelsea’s exclusion would make the girls life a whole lot easier, their conscience kicks in and they decide to put their differences aside and try to help her. But when they approach Chelsea’s father and tell the truth to him, he refuses to believe Jackie’s story. Now the girls must really bite the bullet and choose between the dance party in Hamburg that they’ve so looked forward to attending or finding a way to prove the innocence of their main competition.\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

Not only do they have to figure out a way to get their parents to sign their competition entry forms [an impossible situation for Jackie, whose father has forbidden her to dance] but Chelsea is growing more and more suspicious about where Emma and Ally actually live. Convinced that they are somehow disappearing and reappearing through Jackie’s computer, she steals the laptop and heads directly to a computer repair shop. Unaware of this, Emma prepares to Zap herself through to Singapore. Ally and Jackie frantically try to contact her and stop her but they fail to get through. Fortunately for Emma she arrives out of sight and scurries into hiding as the repairman and Chelsea return to discuss the computer’s erratic behaviour. The girls desperately try to think how they can get Jackie’s computer back before the repairman pulls it apart and leaves them all stuck in Singapore. As well, they’ll also have to somehow convince Chelsea that there is nothing especially strange about it. At the same time, Jackie still needs to get someone from her family to sign her competition entry form. It looks like being a challenging day ahead!\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

Meanwhile, Brett and Cormac have illegally wired into Seamus's satellite dish to watch the soccer final, but all they can get is a kid's show which is doing a live link to Australia where the book is about to go on sale. Unfortunately, Miss Murphy surprises them and then stays to watch the show. Whilst queuing for the book, Hannah uncovers a plot by Wayne to cheat Meredith out of winning a trivia contest. Hannah manages to expose Wayne, but risks exposing her presence in Australia.\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

He flees the scene leaving Brett to take the wrap. Unable to show the police his passport, Brett escapes through the portal to Perth where Wayne has started a business selling pre-loved junk. Hannah and Cormac know that Brett is innocent and play detective to find the real culprit. Martin looks like he's going to get away with it until Brett makes a last trip to bring Seamus a tank badge he's got from Wayne. He catches Martin out and Cormac records the admission. Martin has no choice, but to confess. His apology to Seamus is overheard by the whole school.\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

To save the portal from being plastered over, Brett has to redecorate first and O'Keefe's is throwing out a whole lot of old stage props. In Ireland, the school is on an orienteering course and Hannah's compass is going wild. Each time Brett uses the portal to get props from O'Keefe's, the portal's magnetic energy interferes with the compasses and sends the students off course. If Cormac hadn't issued everyone with a GPS, the entire school would have gotten lost, except for Tara and Martin. Martin isn't using a GPS or compass because he's got a copy of the orienteering map, only he doesn't realise that it's last year's.\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

Aonghus O'Keefe, inventor of the portal and founder of the school, disappeared over 100 years ago and Hannah is keen to find out where he is buried. Brett isn't interested because Tara believes that Brett is secretly wealthy and has suddenly found him attractive. Finding no grave in Ireland, Hannah searches the cemetery in Perth, but still finds nothing so she turns to Jackie for help. Meredith traces Jackie's family tree and discovers that Aonghus married Jackie's great grandmother.

Overloaded with bags, Cassie attempts to contact the Solar Blue Academy but keeps getting the answering machine. To make matters worse, Adam, a teenage boy with a surfboard, asks if she needs some help. She's been warned about strangers like him. Meanwhile, Angus Li the new head of Solar Blue, meets up with former student Bec Sanderson to discuss the re-vamped running of the company. After some clever thinking Cassie finally makes it to the Solar Blue house. The situation doesn't improve on arrival, though. There's 'keep out' signs surrounding the house — not exactly the welcome Cassie had in mind. Then, Adam shows up again! Cassie accuses him of being some crazy stalker. He finally convinces her that he too is part of the academy's intake for the year. They decide to take their luggage off the street and check out the waves. Witnessed by a nosy neighbour, Adam and Cassie emerge from their surf to be confronted by a policeman who accuses them of breaking in. Meanwhile, it's decision-time for Bec. After a reassuring chat with her old coach, Simmo, she takes up Angus's job offer. Her first day back at the academy begins promisingly. She meets the other kids — Charley, Guy, Bridget and Loren — and gets into the swing of things. But then she starts to wonder about the whereabouts of Cassie and Adam...\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

            "description": "As the excitement of moving into Solar Blue slowly fades, reality sets in for Loren. She can't stop comparing herself unfavourably to her team-mates. Firstly it's Bridget, who is super-organised and with the perfect wardrobe to match. Then there's Cassie — nothing intimidates her — not even a blue tongue lizard under the bed. Adam's sense of calm, Charley's belief in himself and Guy's totally unflustered approach to everything. And her real insecurities begin to come out when she starts to compare her surfing skills. Garry arrives for his first week of training. In order to get to know the kids he pushes them to the limits in his preliminary sessions. Loren immediately begins to freak out. Garry not only forgets her name — but singles her out at the end of the session to discuss her posture. Loren's confidence collapses; she feels that he doesn't think that she will ever make it to the pro-circuit. When Loren skips a group trip to the movies, Bec, after some delicate questioning, discovers that Loren doesn't think she'll last long at the Academy. Bec issues Loren with a challenge — one that Loren reluctantly agrees to. There's an afternoon surfing comp coming up with some of the Blue Water locals. As there will be three independent judges doing the scoring, Bec thinks it will be a great way for Loren to get an objective comparison of herself with the other girls. Loren remains convinced she has no way of winning. When her heat begins, her fear is forgotten. Loren surfs well, milking the waves and having fun. After the first two heats, the Solar Blue kids are way ahead. Garry is a bit disappointed at the lack of competition and decides that the final round points will count to the end-of-year scores: three points for first place, two for second and one for third. Loren's convinced she'll be going home so she tries for one last big ride at Blue Water Beach. She heads out the back looking for the biggest and best wave, but in doing so she loses precious minutes of competition time. She finally gets one and it's a beauty. But then disaster strikes...\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

            "description": "Training has well and truly kicked off for the Solar Blue kids and the team is finding it gruelling. For Adam, surfing has always been something he's done for fun, but Garry's extreme training regime begins to make it way too serious. Garry's 'drill sergeant' character and 'boot camp' style training sessions drive him up the wall. The more Adam thinks about his current day-to-day existence, the more he wonders if it's what he really wants. It's the hottest day ever and Garry has planned a gruelling bush walk. Adam is furious. After a long drive, the team are handed maps, compasses and told that if they don't finish under four hours they'll miss out on points for their final point score. At breaking point, Adam snaps when handed a bag weighed down with an extra 15 kilos. He refuses to complete the exercise until it becomes evident that Cassie, his partner, will also miss out on the points if he pulls out. Feeling like he's been blackmailed, he agrees to participate, and the three teams set off on their individual tracks. Adam and Cassie are only two hundred metres from the end when suddenly Cassie slips and drops her bag over the escarpment. Knowing that if they don't complete the task with the weighted bag they won't get the points, Adam decides to climb back down the cliff. The kids are all being tracked on computer by Bec useing a GPS and tracking devices placed in the backpacks. Seeing the bag's quick descent, Bec assumes that someone has fallen and makes a panicked call to Garry. He races to the escarpment and finds Cassie anxiously peering over the edge. Fearing the worst, he is extremely relieved to see Adam climbing up with the fallen bag. Realising that they have put in 100%, Garry sneakily allows extra time for Cassie and Adam to complete the course and earn their points. Back at the house, Adam finally confronts Garry, who reveals that he and Bec were 'testing' them all to see if they really have the mental toughness needed to survive on the pro-circuit.\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

The Solar Blue team begins their first week of school at Blue Water High and for Bridget everything must be just right. Even after Bec's warning that the other students may give them a hard time, the kids all feel positive — but not for long. As Charley, Adam and Guy find their nominated lockers, they meet Mick and Jimmy, the class 'heavies'. A turf war starts over locker positions but the Solar Blue boys refuse to be intimidated. Charley manages to infuriate the thugs even more when he has the nerve to correct their poor grammar. It looks like a tense year ahead for all of them. Meanwhile, Bridget is more than happy to have been allocated a group assignment with and two other classmates. By lunchtime, she has already organised a group meeting and is enthusiastically allocating tasks to the other girls. Back at Solar Blue, the other kids begin to wonder if Bridget is deliberately trying to 'out do' them. Garry also starts to worry, after telling her that her board turns are fine, Bridget automatically thinks that they can be better and goes out for more practice. She's also getting up earlier than everyone to do extra laps in the pool. Back at the school lockers, Charley, Adam and Guy are still having problems with Mick and Jimmy. Their lockers have now been bashed in with a hammer — and it's pretty obvious who's to blame. Mick and Jimmy see this as the perfect way to get rid of the Solar Blue kids, but when the boys embrace their newly-sculpted lockers and refuse to move, the bullies are left defeated. While the boys have resolved their problems, Bridget's continue to get worse. Her assignment-group fail to show up at their next meeting and she overhears Gina saying that she is \"up herself\" and that she \"has no life\". Bridget is devastated.\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

            "description": "Guy loves life and life loves Guy. He hasn't got a worry in the world, can always see an upside to everything and luck is usually on his side. However, Guy's luck is about to change — in a big way. In return for some maths coaching, Guy invites Bridget out to pizza and a movie on the weekend. When Bridget sees what he's intending to wear, she's appalled and offers to take him shopping. After choosing a shirt together, Bridget heads off to another store, leaving Guy behind to pay the bill. Guy asks another customer if she knows where the cashier is. To his surprise — she's rude and dismissive and doesn't help him at all. Stunned by the girl's attitude, Guy pays for his shirt and leaves. Just as he's out the door, he remembers his bag and runs back in to get it. Leaving the store a second time is not nearly as easy. The shop owner stops him and demands to search his bag. Baffled, he opens it only to be shocked by its contents — it's filled with the shop's jewellery! Guy's suddenly in serious trouble for shoplifting. News gets back to Solar Blue that Guy has been arrested. They can't believe that Guy would steal anything from anyone — let alone jewellery from a surf shop. To cheer him up, Bridget prints out a photo of their celebrations at the café from the day before. As Guy looks closely at the picture, he recognises the rude girl from the store in the background and is convinced he was set up.\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

            "description": "For Cassie, school is fine, training's good and her surfing is always getting better. Everything is travelling along smoothly — at least, it was. Suddenly Cassie's balance goes all out of whack. Concentrating at school becomes impossible, she starts to fall behind in training and the wipeouts come to visit as a regular occurrence. This lapse in concentration can only be blamed on one person — Adam. Cassie's infatuation with him hits new heights. When 'Birdwatchers Quarterly' arrives for him in the post, Cassie assumes this strange hobby is all part of Adam's personality. In the hope that sharing this interest will bring them closer together, Cassie hits the internet in search of information about the elusive 'Lewin's Rail'. Not picking up that Adam hasn't the slightest interest in bird-watching, Cassie continues to read and research about the birds, dropping hints to Adam along the way. He clearly doesn't catch on, as Cassie's hobby turns into an obsession. Cassie, with all good intentions, plans a surprise bird-watching picnic for Adam. Loren is horrified and tries to talk her out of it but Cassie can't be swayed. Thinking that Cassie is missing her family, Adam accepts her invitation but is disappointed to be skipping the spectacular waves on offer at Blue Water Beach. Adam is bored stiff at the bird-watching picnic but is doing his best to be polite. While Cassie assumes his quiet behaviour is because he thinks she doesn't know what she's talking about, her obsession to find the Lewin's Rail becomes a little manic. She finally spots what could be the bird, orders Adam to get the camera, and then clambers over the rocks for a better sighting. Suddenly Cassie slips and falls into the water, hitting her head.\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

            "description": "Charley has never been one to back down from a challenge and thrives on pushing himself. Everything he does he wants to do to the best of his ability. For Charley, life is a series of hurdles and the fun lies in jumping over them as high as possible. At a third of the way through the year, it looks like Charley's approach is paying off. On the points board — he's sitting pretty on equal top with Bridget. To add to the high, a regional surf comp is on and Charley is pumped. With the first round completed, the Solar Blue boys blitz their opponents. Having performed particularly well, Charley is surprised and somewhat flattered to see that three enthusiastic, teenage girls have formed his very own, personal cheer squad! Slightly embarrassed, but secretly enjoying the attention, Charlie poses with the girls while they embrace him and take pictures. After round two, Charley's new fan club goes ballistic when he is announced the overall winner. Just when life is full of accolades and success, Charley starts to tumble downwards. His fall starts slowly. A few days later when the alarm goes off for morning training, Charley can only drag himself out of bed with severe difficulty. No matter how hard he pushes himself, his body just won't do what he's asking of it. Everything suddenly becomes a major effort — and even his little mind games don't work to motivate him anymore. Bec finally takes him to the doctor for a blood test. Charley assumes he has tonsillitis but the diagnosis is much worse...\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

But the situation quickly deteriorates when it becomes clear that her father is extremely unhappy with the inadequate and inappropriate training he feels Loren is getting. After watching Loren surf, Brian is furious that Garry has changed her style and accuses both Bec and Garry of ruining her chances of succeeding on the pro-circuit. He demands that Loren return home so he can get her a more experienced coach who can give her personalised attention. Suddenly Loren is in the awful dilemma of having to choose between Solar Blue and her family. Feeling under intense pressure, Loren considers the options and comes to her decision. But deciding on something and then communicating it to the people involved are two different challenges. One thing's for sure though, after she does announce her decision, the relationships between all concerned will never be quite the same again.\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

            "description": "As the Solar Blue team heads to a new surf spot, Adam's secret fear of sharks resurfaces. Since he started the year he's managed to keep a lid on his anxiety but suddenly and unexpectedly it's back. And the more he thinks about it, the worse his fear becomes. Adding salt to the wound, Adam can't help but observe how well his house mates are able to openly declare and cope with their fears while he has difficulty even admitting his to himself. Even more troubling though is the realisation that — unless he can overcome this fear — Adam knows that he has no future as a surfer. While Adam struggles with his internal demons, Cassie shrewdly guesses his problem and confronts him about it. Reluctant at first, Adam finally admits the truth and so Cassie sets out to help him. Adam is a difficult 'patient' but Cassie is a determined friend who won't take 'no' for an answer. Cassie suggests they enlist the assistance of Bec and Garry and together they embark on a course of action that is simple, direct and hopefully effective. It will require Adam to go on a scuba dive in a local aquarium and swim amongst several sharks. The prospect horrifies him but so too does the idea of leaving Solar Blue and giving up his ambitions to become a pro-surfer. In order to meet the challenge Adam will have to dig down deep into his inner resources. Luckily for him though, he has a great friend in Cassie to help him find the way.\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

            "description": "Fly pays a visit to the Solar Blue Academy. Charley is depressed and broods over his 'bad luck'. Before catching glandular fever he had everything to look forward to. Now one, simple, little kiss later he's unable to train and unable to remain at Solar Blue. Disheartened, he figures that even if he is able to return in a month or so, he'll never catch up with the fitness levels of the others. So he decides to resign from the academy for good. Loren is devastated by Charley's news and urges him to reconsider. But it's to no avail, Charley has made up his mind and that's it. As luck would have it though, Fly drops in to Solar Blue on her way to Perth. Loren seizes the opportunity and asks her to visit Charley to see if she can convince him to return. Fly can't promise she'll succeed but she does agree to talk to him. Soon after, Charley and Fly meet and he quite bluntly tells her that nothing she can say will convince him to return to Solar Blue. To Charley's great surprise, Fly announces that she has no intention of saying anything. On the contrary, she's going to take him for a picnic. Charley reluctantly allows himself to be dragged along — only to discover (like many others have before him) that it's very easy to underestimate the diminutive Fly. As it happens, the picnic presents him with an experience that will turn his life around completely.\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

When comparing herself to the other kids in the house however, she begins to wonder if Guy is that special person.

Her uncertainty escalates when her classmate, Patrick, asks her to the movies on the same night as the Solar Blue team are going bowling.

Solar Blue needs to make a commercial contribution to the parent company, Matsusito, and Angus wants the kids to promote the new board. They're told that they must use it in the next comp, but their first practice session is a disaster. Not only is the board too light, it's seriously unstable and they all have trouble just staying upright. But with the CEO of Matsusito coming to watch the competition, Angus is adamant that they must persist with the new boards — and win! With the future of the Academy at stake, the kids feel that they have no choice but to try and make the best of it. After a disastrous first round, Cassie decides that promoting a product that is no good, just isn't worth it. She convinces the rest of the kids to use their own boards; if this is their last surf for Solar Blue, then they may as well look good! With a renewed sense of conviction, the team blow the competition out of the water. But will Matsusito allow the Academy to remain open?\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

            "description": "Guy loves training, loves the whole routine of sameness and certainty. But with the group under-performing in all of the drills, a change is needed. Guy can't understand how modifying the basic training program will make them any fitter and is strongly against breaking their routine. When the girls suggest dance classes as an alternative, Guy is horrified. Being forced to make a change is one thing, but dancing is a whole new problem. Lacking rhythm and with two left feet, Guy struggles to follow the steps. He throws in the towel, ostracises his house mates and refuses to attend any more classes. Bec and Garry read him the riot act and Guy is forced to try again. After taking some private classes with the dance teacher, he realises the training can actually help his surfing. Not only does he readjust his balance, he makes up with his house mates. The surf comp reveals the improvement in all of them. Re-focused and re-motivated, the kids all surf better than they have for months.\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

            "description": "According to Charley, everyone has their weird side, even though they might seem 'normal' on the outside. As the kids enjoy a day of surfing, Bernie, an elderly man, watches them from the beach. Back at the house, Charley reads about an old woman, Rosemary Wilson, who's gone missing. According to the pamphlet, she was one of the first women surfers in the area and won the inaugural Blue Water Beach Women's comp back in 1955. During their various training sessions, Charley notices that Bernie is taking an unnatural interest in their activities. Realising this is not 'normal', he confronts the man, only to be asked to spread the ashes of his dearest friend — the recently deceased, 'Rosie' — in the ocean. Perturbed and assuming that 'Rosie' is the missing elderly woman, Charley and Bec take the ashes to the police, but are told that the old lady has actually been found. So whose ashes has Charley been given?\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

He's on a mercy mission: their younger brother Ben has broken his ankle, and he needs Bridget to replace him in a skateboarding event being held just near Blue Water Beach. Eager to help her brothers win the race, Bridget tries to convince Bec and Garry that skateboarding is perfectly safe and that there's little risk of injury. James can see this strategy isn't working and secretly tells Bec and Garry that he's hatched a fake plot to get his whole family together for their mother's birthday. Meanwhile, Charley and Guy come home to find two of James's spare skateboards against the wall of the house. Assuming they've been left there for some 'dry land' practice, they take them out for a spin, with disastrous results. Out of control, they skate down the street and crash into a garage sale, creating havoc.\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

Back at Solar Blue, he's evasive about his movements, and for the next week or so, he continually makes up excuses about his whereabouts. Cassie immediately jumps to the conclusion that Charley is cheating on Loren. Her suspicions are confirmed when Adam and Guy spot him with the same mystery girl at a café. Cassie finally snaps and accuses Charley of lying to them all and cheating on Loren. Shocked and upset, Charley storms off. After meeting Loren on the beach, explanations are in order. Back at the house, Charley confesses what has really been happening. Ellie, the mystery girl, is actually his sister. She's run away from school and Charley's been trying to help her. The kids are embarrassed at the lack of trust and respect they've shown Charley. They realise that even when all the evidence suggests otherwise — a friend is a friend — and that's pretty much all that matters.\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

With perfect waves, Cassie, whose confidence is at an all-time high, forgets all the rules. She's sucked in by a rip and lands on a rock ledge. Wiping out spectacularly, she injures her foot and is rescued by Adam. Garry is furious at the kids' lack of surf safety and Cassie feels like a complete idiot. To make matters worse, her foot won't be healed in time for the next competition, so she'll miss out on valuable points. Watching her team-mates training hard and getting ahead, Cassie's confidence goes into free fall as she realises her whole year at Solar Blue is in jeopardy. Adam can't bear to watch her self-destruct and makes her enter an ocean swim race. Reluctant at first, Cassie soon discovers that the swimming training makes her feel great. Finally, it's competition day and she ends up placing in the first ten — good enough to score the points needed to keep up with her team-mates.\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

Having done his best to avoid any distractions during the year, Guy's best intentions are suddenly overturned when he is instantly smitten with her. Within days he's learning French and feigning a deep interest in wetland conservation in order to do whatever it takes to impress Natalie. But these distractions soon take his attention away from his obligations to Solar Blue and he fails to put in the required training for an approaching comp. As a result, Guy's poor performance leads Solar Blue to place second and causes a sponsorship deal with their parent company to be cancelled. Knowing he has let everyone down, Guy feels embarrassed and humiliated. But his luck turns — the local newspaper features a photo of Guy, dressed in his Solar Blue t-shirt and taken while he was helping Natalie in her conservation campaign. The parent company is delighted with the positive publicity and comes through with the sponsorship after all. Back on a high, Guy builds up the courage to ask Natalie to the school dance only to find that she already has a boyfriend. The news devastates Guy at first but then he realises he has no alternative but to accept his fate. He determines to put love to one side and go back to focus on his surfing.\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

            "description": "With summer approaching, the Solar Blue kids find out what it's really like to share the waves. When Cassie gets hit on the arm by a young local's wayward surfboard, it seems a surf war is about to break out. Adam tries to reason with the offending surfers, but his overtures are quickly rejected and he suddenly finds himself the victim of some blatant racism. Things get even worse the next day at school when he finds an unflattering drawing with an offensive caption stuck on his locker. Down at the beach, the mayhem on the waves is compounded by another group of locals — this time it's the older Malibu riders, and one surfs straight over Adam's board, breaking it in two. It seems the Solar Blue team is being attacked from all sides and Bec has to step in to try and bring some sense to the situation before it really gets out of control. Meanwhile at school, racist abuse continues to be directed at Adam. Realising he needs to take action, Adam surreptitiously gathers some incriminating evidence and confronts the perpetrators. He gives them an ultimatum: they can either formally apologise and go surf another beach or the evidence will be presented to the principal and the police. Will the boys back off?\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

            "description": "When Charley states that his whole year at Solar Blue will be a waste unless he wins, Loren is crestfallen. She feels that getting into Solar Blue is a major success in itself. Even more than that, she believes that the relationship she's formed with Charley is also an important achievement and it hurts her to see that Charley doesn't seem to attach the same significance to it as she does. The revelation causes Loren to re-evaluate her priorities. She recognises that to 'own' herself again, she's got to focus on winning the finals - and that means looking again at her relationship with Charley. Meanwhile Bridget is encountering the issue of success on different terms. She's been invited to accompany top surfer, Grant Fabier, to some promotional events. Everyone urges her to accept this golden opportunity. It's not just a leg up the ladder to success, it's a chance to achieve overnight fame. However, Bridget quickly discovers that fame is not all that it's cut out to be. Indeed, if fame means having to hide who you really are and pretend to be someone you're not, then is it really worth it?\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

            "description": "Guy decides that in order to stand a chance of winning the finals he needs to become much more competitive in his outlook and approach. As a result he turns everything he does into a form of competition. Whether it's bed-making, sandwich-making or getting to school first - nothing is too trivial to be excluded from Guy's competitive embrace. Charley and Adam soon catch on and instinctively rise to the challenge that Guy's thrown down. The effect means that daily life becomes a non-stop race - and the girls are singularly unimpressed. Things come to a head when the boys are asked to sell cookies for charity. It's the perfect opportunity for them to compete and they jump at the chance to outdo each other. But the results are a disaster and the local main street degenerates into a melee of competing boys and arguing customers that quickly leads to trouble. Deciding that things have gone too far, Garry puts his foot down. He signs them all up for a team event at a weekend surf carnival where the boys will have to work together instead of in competition with each other.\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

Unnoticed by the other housemates, the extra pointers and private sessions with Garry start to grate with Cassie. She feels that favoritism is playing a big part in the week leading up to competition day. Her suspicions are confirmed when she overhears Loren talking to Bec and Garry in the office and it seems unmistakeable that Loren has been pre-determined to win. Cassie is shocked. At Loren's birthday dinner she explodes, accusing Bec, Garry and Loren of cheating. The other housemates are startled by her outburst and Cassie concludes that if the competition is already decided, then she might as well leave the academy before the final surf-off. Eventually the truth of the situation emerges, but not without some negative effects - the major one being whether Cassie's friendship with Loren has been irretrievably damaged by the experience.\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

But when Angus makes a surprise visit to the Academy, his news throws the whole event into turmoil. Solar Blue is to be closed with immediate effect and there's no money for a wild card or a year's worth of sponsorship. Bec, Garry and the kids are devastated. Everything that they have been working towards has been taken away and there is nothing they can do. Simmo returns as a surprise judge and refuses to accept the news. After convincing a local surf company to supply the team with both the wild cards and the sponsorship money needed for a year on the circuit, the event is saved and the surf off begins. The competition is tight. Simmo congratulates the kids, telling them that it's the best Solar Blue finals he has ever seen. Now, there's only one remaining issue to finalise - which girl and which boy will win the wild cards?\n\nSubscribe here - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN_vBvnKZ4x2X6wWUMPpIwg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nHere on Totes Amaze you can find totally amazing teen tv shows.

As they pile out of the Kombi, they're introduced to Dan, their instructor for the weekend. Tanned, fit and according to the girls, a \"whole lot cuter\" than expected, his idea of training is to shake people out of their comfort zones. Adam, however, immediately dislikes him. Feeling that Dan is showing unnecessarily close attention to Cassie he becomes jealous and disagreeable. He's especially infuriated when it seems that Dan assumes the mantle of 'hero' after rescuing Cassie when one of their training exercises goes wrong.

When Lord Raiden, God of Thunder and protector of Earth, finds himself in an earthly mental institution in the year 2011, his 'delusions' are treated with some rather primitive forms of therapy (involving an ECT machine and an ice pick).  Nonetheless, Blue, his beautiful, fragile yet insane fellow inmate, is Raiden's only hope of escaping the mental hospital and making his way to the Mortal Kombat tournament to defend Earthrealm from Shao Khan.\n\nDirected by Kevin Tancharoen\nWritten by Todd Helbing & Aaron Helbing\nProduced by Kevin Tancharoen, Lance Sloane, Tim Carter\n\nCAST \nRaiden....................................................................................RYAN ROBBINS\nBlue.......................................................................................TRACY SPIRIDAKOS\nDr Gadsen..............................................................................PETER HALL\nWhite Coat # 1.......................................................................LAURO CHARTRAND\nWhite Coat # 2.......................................................................SYLVESTA STUART\nWhite Coat # 3.......................................................................LARNELL STOVALL\n\nThis original live-action new media series is produced by Warner Bros.

            "description": "Wanted\nA case of mistaken identity lands Bean in prison and the escaped convict pretends to be Mr. Bean! The real Bean ends up in prison and makes a teddy with dough while the impostor is forced by Mrs. Wicket to do Rockery except failed to realized that the \"Bean\" she saw was a fake. Then, when the impostor is fed up on this job, he runs away and goes back to his prison cell and explains to Bean that he was the one who escaped and pretends to be Bean. When he's out of the prison, he shouts \"I'm free!\" except it attracts the attention of the prison guards.\n\nThe Visitor \nA friend named Harry goes for a visit to Mr. Bean's room. Unfortunately for Bean, Harry has different things and also is a gluttonous guy who eats too much, so much that all the food in Bean's fridge is gone. Bean tries to get rid of his friend except his teddy is being stolen so he tries to get it back from Harry. Then, he decides to make him go to a restaurant and orders everything in the menu, and escapes from the bathroom when Harry's not looking. Then, when Harry fails to pay the bill, he is forced to wash the dishes as payment and Bean manages to get his teddy back.\n\nChocks Away\nAfter Teddy gets torn by a boy's radio-controlled model aeroplane, Mr. Bean decides to get revenge by buying his own model plane. As a girl was trying to buy the last plane in the shop's stock, he throws the girl's doll and manages to buy the plane, except he gets bumped by the guard and finds one part to be missing: the propeller. He goes back to the toy store only to be blocked by the guard but manages to fool him and retrieves the propeller. Bean then flies the plane, with Teddy riding as pilot, and manages to knock down the boy's plane. The boy's father then breaks Bean's remote, while the plane is still in flight, causing the plane to go out of sight. Bean believes he has lost Teddy forever, but then the plane explodes and Teddy is ejected and returns down his chimney.\n\nHypnotised Bean\nBean attends a hypnotism show. He unwittingly volunteers to be hypnotised; when the hypnotist makes him think he's a dog, he runs away and then back at home chases Scrapper around the garden and the house.\n\n\nStay tuned:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkAGrHCLFmlK3H2kd6isipg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWelcome to the official Mr Bean Channel.

            "description": "Homeless\nMr Bean hunts for a new home, as Mrs. Wicket has thrown him out. He tries out some lodgings he sees advertised in the paper but the series of attempts failed: First, Bean is appalled when the landlady serves him exotic food that turns out to be crocodile. The next apartment forbids Teddy inside. Then a man gives him a bed-space alongside the home of pigs and chickens. Lastly is the burglar duo's fake house. Bean tries to camp out until a downpour interrupts his sleep. Then, when Bean sees his room for rent, he decides to disguise himself to get back in. When Mrs. Wicket sleepwalks to his room, he carries her back into the room. However, as she awakes, she panics and Bean shows himself, pretends that he attacks the man and throws him out of the window. Mrs. Wicket, thinking that Bean has \"subdued\" him, welcomes him back.\n\nSupermarrow \nMr. Bean and the father-and-son compete for the incoming biggest marrow competition. Thanks to the super light lamps, Mr. Bean's marrow grows heavier until the father and son decide to put caterpillars in Bean's marrow. Then, when they see Bean with his marrow, they want to swap their marrow with his but fail to realize that the caterpillars are inside. So Bean convinces the judge that the marrow he's holding is his and wins the trophy dropping the marrow on the old lady.\n\nBean Shopping\nMr. Bean is locked in a department store overnight and has the time of his life.\n\nBack to School \nWhen there's no milk for his tea and for teddy, Mr. Bean goes to buy milk. However, instead of parking near the grocery store because of the traffic warden, he parks his car at a nearby school. He is unexpectedly brought in by the principal who mistakes Mr. Bean as the new teacher and is forced to teach a group of juvenile delinquents, but he actually may be a better teacher than he thought.\n\nStay tuned:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkAGrHCLFmlK3H2kd6isipg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWelcome to the official Mr Bean Channel.

            "description": "Wanted\nA case of mistaken identity lands Bean in prison and the escaped convict pretends to be Mr. Bean! The real Bean ends up in prison and makes a teddy with dough while the impostor is forced by Mrs. Wicket to do Rockery except failed to realized that the \"Bean\" she saw was a fake. Then, when the impostor is fed up on this job, he runs away and goes back to his prison cell and explains to Bean that he was the one who escaped and pretends to be Bean. When he's out of the prison, he shouts \"I'm free!\" except it attracts the attention of the prison guards.\n\nThe Visitor \nA friend named Harry goes for a visit to Mr. Bean's room. Unfortunately for Bean, Harry has different things and also is a gluttonous guy who eats too much, so much that all the food in Bean's fridge is gone. Bean tries to get rid of his friend except his teddy is being stolen so he tries to get it back from Harry. Then, he decides to make him go to a restaurant and orders everything in the menu, and escapes from the bathroom when Harry's not looking. Then, when Harry fails to pay the bill, he is forced to wash the dishes as payment and Bean manages to get his teddy back.\n\nChocks Away\nAfter Teddy gets torn by a boy's radio-controlled model aeroplane, Mr. Bean decides to get revenge by buying his own model plane. As a girl was trying to buy the last plane in the shop's stock, he throws the girl's doll and manages to buy the plane, except he gets bumped by the guard and finds one part to be missing: the propeller. He goes back to the toy store only to be blocked by the guard but manages to fool him and retrieves the propeller. Bean then flies the plane, with Teddy riding as pilot, and manages to knock down the boy's plane. The boy's father then breaks Bean's remote, while the plane is still in flight, causing the plane to go out of sight. Bean believes he has lost Teddy forever, but then the plane explodes and Teddy is ejected and returns down his chimney.\n\nHypnotised Bean\nBean attends a hypnotism show. He unwittingly volunteers to be hypnotised; when the hypnotist makes him think he's a dog, he runs away and then back at home chases Scrapper around the garden and the house.\n\n\nStay tuned:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkAGrHCLFmlK3H2kd6isipg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWelcome to the official Mr Bean Channel.

            "description": "Homeless\nMr Bean hunts for a new home, as Mrs. Wicket has thrown him out. He tries out some lodgings he sees advertised in the paper but the series of attempts failed: First, Bean is appalled when the landlady serves him exotic food that turns out to be crocodile. The next apartment forbids Teddy inside. Then a man gives him a bed-space alongside the home of pigs and chickens. Lastly is the burglar duo's fake house. Bean tries to camp out until a downpour interrupts his sleep. Then, when Bean sees his room for rent, he decides to disguise himself to get back in. When Mrs. Wicket sleepwalks to his room, he carries her back into the room. However, as she awakes, she panics and Bean shows himself, pretends that he attacks the man and throws him out of the window. Mrs. Wicket, thinking that Bean has \"subdued\" him, welcomes him back.\n\nSupermarrow \nMr. Bean and the father-and-son compete for the incoming biggest marrow competition. Thanks to the super light lamps, Mr. Bean's marrow grows heavier until the father and son decide to put caterpillars in Bean's marrow. Then, when they see Bean with his marrow, they want to swap their marrow with his but fail to realize that the caterpillars are inside. So Bean convinces the judge that the marrow he's holding is his and wins the trophy dropping the marrow on the old lady.\n\nBean Shopping\nMr. Bean is locked in a department store overnight and has the time of his life.\n\nBack to School \nWhen there's no milk for his tea and for teddy, Mr. Bean goes to buy milk. However, instead of parking near the grocery store because of the traffic warden, he parks his car at a nearby school. He is unexpectedly brought in by the principal who mistakes Mr. Bean as the new teacher and is forced to teach a group of juvenile delinquents, but he actually may be a better teacher than he thought.\n\nStay tuned:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkAGrHCLFmlK3H2kd6isipg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWelcome to the official Mr Bean Channel.

Bean plays a coconut shy but, after failing to win, he sneaks inside and finds it was a cheat — the coconut is glued to the tripod. Thus, the angry owner pursues Bean around the funfair — via a horror ride, a roller coaster, a candy floss stall, and finally a helter skelter, which ends with the owner being thrown and landing in his own kiosk. Bean obtains the female teddy bear and buys two cups for Teddy and the female Teddy.\n\nStay tuned:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkAGrHCLFmlK3H2kd6isipg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWelcome to the official Mr Bean Channel.

As he tries to use it, his card is declined and eventually swallowed by the machine. Bean steals a box of tools from a repairman's truck to unscrew the front of the machine in order to retrieve his card, thereby triggering the cash dispenser's alarm and alerting the police. Bean manages to hide inside the machine before the police officers find him. He then accidentally falls into the vault, finds his card and escapes just as the police officers raid the vault. Bean tries his card again after realising that his note of his PIN was upside down (he was reading it as 1861, but in fact it is 1981). Finally, Bean successfully withdraws the money and buys the cupcake. As Bean drives back home, the police officers mistakenly suspect and arrest the repairman.\n\nStay tuned:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkAGrHCLFmlK3H2kd6isipg?sub_confirmation=1\n\nWelcome to the official Mr Bean Channel.

The commitment to the new opportunity would be for a minimum two years, which Adhira is reluctant to make at the age of 25. Whereas Shagun, having already quit her high paying corporate job to join this business, sees no harm in seizing the opportunity with open arms. As their argument turns to a fight, we are left wondering if this is in fact the fight to end all fights. Will the sisters come to the same page and work for the pitch? Or will Happily Hitched disband for good?\n\nSubscribe to Dice Media here: http://bit.ly/SubToDiceMedia",
